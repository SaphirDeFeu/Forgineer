# FORGINEER

A Fabric mod for those who yearn for an expanded mining experience.  
  
Move deep inside the earth to uncover hidden treasures and ores to upgrade your equipment and character.  
  
While there is not much for the early game, the goal is to make the mines inviting even for the end game.
